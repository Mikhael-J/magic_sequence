#    @details Solve the magic sequence problem with backtracking

#    "A magic sequence of length $n$ is a sequence of integers $x_0
#    \ldots x_{n-1}$ between $0$ and $n-1$, such that for all $i$
#    in $0$ to $n-1$, the number $i$ occurs exactly $x_i$ times in
#    the sequence. For instance, $6,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0$ is a magic
#    sequence since $0$ occurs $6$ times in it, $1$ occurs twice, etc."
